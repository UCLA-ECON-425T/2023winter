## Checklist on your resume

* Machine learning methods. 

- [ ] Supervised learning (classification, prediction, forecasting)  
- [ ] Scikit-Learn
- [ ] Keras+Tensorflow (PyTorch if applicable)
- [ ] XGBoost  

* Know the material in ISL2 and ESL2 by heart. 

* Create a GitHub repo for the coursework and show your work to back your resume.     

## What's not covered

Make sure to acquire data importing (text files, internet, databases), data wrangling, data visualization, high performance computing, and software engineering skills.

- [ ] Linux scripting  
- [ ] Git/GitHub (put your GitHub handle on resume)  
- [ ] Data wrangling (pandas)   
- [ ] Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)  
- [ ] Frontend development (shiny, web app)  
- [ ] Databases, SQL (Google BigQuery)  
- [ ] Cloud computing (GCP, AWS, Azure, OCI)  
- [ ] High-performance computing (HPC) on cluster (if you use Hoffman2)  

- Computational algorithms. Numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization algorithms. 

- Economics or business applications.

- Be open to languages. **R** is equally popular in data science community. **Julia** is attractive for high performance scientific computing. **JavaScript** is dominant in web applications. **Scala** is popular for implementing distributed programs.

## QAs

* Course materials: git clone or fork.

* Search strategy besides exhaustive search: [`GridSearchCV()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV), [`RandomizedSearchCV()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV), ... See [reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#hyper-parameter-optimizers).

* HW6. 

## Plan for today

* Overview of select topics: unsupervised learning, survival analysis, A/B testing, causal analysis, conformal prediction.
